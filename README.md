### General info  
Adds a new factory building, the Pressure Modulator in tier 6.

The pressure modulator can pressurize fluids in a 5:1 ratio. The pressurized fluids can be further processed into compressed fluids in a 2:1 ratio, achieving a 10:1 effective compression as a result. These super-compressed fluids do not require pumps to be transported due to the extreme pressure.

Pressurized and compressed fluids cannot be packaged (due to the high pressure).

One pressure modulator can process normal fluids into pressurized fluids at 240m³/min (into 48m³/min).  
One pressure modulator can process normal fluids into compressed fluids at 120m³/min (into 12m³/min).  
One pressure modulator can process pressurized fluids into compressed fluids at 240m³/min (into 120m³/min).  

The pressure modulator can be overclocked up to 250%, but cannot duplicate (boost) fluids using Somersloops.

### Intent  

Increase the throughput of fluid trains at the cost of additional power (10 MW / Pressure Modulator) and increased complexity.  
Allow fewer pipes to be built over long range at the cost of complexity. As compressed fluids do not require pumps, the power cost of transporting fluids through pipes is flattened, but the initial cost is usually higher unless the vertical distance traveled is high.

### Known issues  

You can raise new issues [here](https://github.com/Argual/Satisfactory-ArgualFluidPressurizer/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). Please provide detailed information, and maybe even a save file set up for quick inspection. I spend limited time in Discord, so the main way to reach me is through the issues page.

- Upon unlocking the pressure modulator, ADA forgets to unmute the mic, so the pioneers can only read the subtitles.
>Waiting for better audio modding utilities, the sound is made, but I cannot make it play for now.

- Pressurized and Compressed fluids have the same icons as their normal variants.
>No plans to change this for now.

### Screenshots  

The screenshots below show a 100% efficient conversion of 1200m³/min water to 120m³/min compressed water. The images also demonstrate that the final result (compressed water) does not need pumps to flow into the elevated buffer.
